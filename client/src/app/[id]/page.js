                On the 8th of January 1947, the University of Rajputana appeared
                like a little star on the educational horizon of pre-independent
                India. That little star, now called the University of Rajasthan
                is shining "like a diamond in the sky." Having acquired the
                status of University with Potential for Excellence, today, the
                University celebrates its 68th Foundation Day. Over the years
                the University has redefined itself keeping in mind the changing
                trends of the educational system.

                But let us travel down memory lane and recall how this
                University was set up. The efforts for a separate University for
                Rajputana State were initiated as early as 1921 when the Act for
                the Allahabad University was passed. The Act prescribed for
                separation of Intermediate classes from the Degree classes as a
                condition for affiliation, which meant more expenditure for the
                then colleges at Jaipur, Jodhpur and Ajmer, the only colleges
                then imparting University education and affiliated to Allahabad
                University. The location of the University became a
                controversial issue. The question was considered in all its
                aspects at a meeting called by the Agent to the Governor General
                in Rajputana and attended by the ruling Princes and Chiefs at
                Mt. Abu on 20- June 1924. It was finally decided that 'the
                general sense of the Conference seems to be that there are
                strong obstacles at present to a Rajputana University, and that
                the scheme is premature but that the respective advantages of
                affiliating either with Agra or with Delhi under changed
                conditions as can be brought about should be explored.' The
                colleges in Rajasthan (erstwhile Rajputana) were then affiliated
                to Agra University after it was established in 1927. After a gap
                of nearly two decades the efforts were again initiated in 1942
                by Sir Mirza Ismail, the then Prime Minister of Jaipur, who
                appointed J.C. Rollo as Special Education Officer for this
                purpose. Sir Mirza Ismail and his successor in office Sir V.T.
                Krishnamachari, took the initiative of holding talks with the
                representatives of Udaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Aiwar and Jaipur
                in December, 1946. They agreed to the establishment of a
                University at Jaipur and on 8- January, 1947, legislation was
                promulgated and the colleges in the State formally federated
                into the University of Rajputana, which came into existence in
                July the same year. It was the last (2 1st) university that was
                set up in pre- independent India.

                The University office was temporarily set up in the Kesargarh
                Fort. The then Maharaja of Jaipur State, Sawai Man Singh
                graciously made available to the university an extensive site of
                over 300 acres. About two miles from the centre of the city, the
                site was considered ideal for a University campus. With the Moti
                Doongari castle overlooking the campus on the northern side, and
                the Jhalana hills stretching from end to end in the east, the
                site possessed that wild grandeur that characterised most
                landmarks of Rajasthan.

                Dr. G. S. Mahajani, who was at that time Principal of Ferguson
                College, Poona (now Pune) was appointed the first
                Vice-Chancellor of the University. Dr. Mahajani was in many
                respects an ideal person. He was a member of the Servants of
                India Society. He used to walk to the University office from his
                residence and did not maintain a car. Shri M. M. Verma was
                appointed the first Registrar, who worked very closely with Dr.
                Mahajani.

                The University was granted an annual grant of Rs.2.5 lacs by the
                participating States of Rajputana. What is remarkable is that
                the States made it clear that the "acceptance of the grant will
                in no way detract from the autonomy of the University and its
                freedom to organise its teaching and administration as to embody
                in them the highest conception of University life." The
                University has made a significant contribution in the field of
                higher education. A peep into the past has many interesting
                features to reveal its progressive and dynamic outlook since its
                very beginning. The foundations laid for this University are
                deep and strong as is amply borne out by the following extract
                from the address delivered by Shri J. C. Rollo, on the 28- July
                1947 at the meeting of the Academic Council. "This is the first
                meeting of academic council of the University. It is of happy
                significance that the first body to meet should be the Academic
                Council. It helps to emphasize the fact that this University is
                to be one in which academic considerations, academic
                responsibility, shall always come first. This Council is the
                academic conscience of the University; and, as the first person
                honoured with its Chairmanship, I venture to suggest that today
                and always the members may firmly maintain, at whatever cost,
                the highest standards and the soundest policy from an academic
                point of view. Finally, might I respectfully ask that from the
                beginning every member may exercise a free and independent
                personal judgment and may never accept the dictation of any
                group of persons; a habit that has proved ruinous to some
                Universities. In the University of Raj putana independence will
                not be dangerous."

                The University Motto, "Dharmo Vishwasya Jagatah Pratishtha"
                suggested by the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. G. S. Mahajani was
                accepted by the Executive Council at its meeting held on 28-
                January, 1948. "This enshrines the greatest contribution India
                has made to world thought: and it is our earnest hope that
                Universities in India will assist in the rediscovery of
                spiritual values which the world needs at the present time." In
                February, 1949, Shri V. T. Krishnamachari, the Diwan of the
                Jaipur State and Pro Vice Chancellor of the University said in
                his welcome speech, "The University has now been in existence
                for over 1-1/2 years and its progress during this period has
                been gratifying. For this the credit goes to Dr. Mahajani and
                those who work with him. The University bodies have settled down
                to their work and the University has begun to conduct all its
                examinations and has also obtained recognition for its degrees."
                We are trying for the establishment of an Engineering College in
                Jodhpur and Agricultural College in Bikaner.

                Shri C. Rajagopalachari, the first Governor General of free
                India, had a very clear idea of the importance of the
                universities and their dignity. Speaking to the students of
                Loyala College, Madras in August 1948, he had observed "we have
                to maintain the highest standards for our universities. The
                pressure of democracy may be allowed to bear on anything else,
                but not on the standard of education. Do not compel the
                universities to come down to you. You must go up the steps to
                reach the universities."

                The foundation stone of the University Campus was laid by Shri
                C. Rajagopalachari on Sunday, the February 20, 1949. He
                concluded his address on the occasion with these words, "Nothing
                can be achieved unless we learn to be good and correct and
                self-disciplined and cultivate self-restraint and that, which is
                called dharma in our beautiful language." The motto of the
                University calls upon the faculty and the students to spread
                this Dharma throughout the world, to make the planet earth a
                better place to live. Dharma is the stabilising factor for the
                whole world and if this new university which will, in the
                history that will be written, be associated with free India,
                truly a Rajputana University, is built on that foundation
                according to its motto, nothing will prevent India from becoming
                great. I invoke blessings of God on this new foundation." The
                jurisdiction of this University at that time extended over the
                entire Rajputana State with the exception of Ajmer-Merwara. In
                the beginning, it was only an affiliating University with
                twenty-two colleges in different parts of the state and it also
                controlled High School and Intermediate Education. After the
                merger of Ajmer-Merwara with the State of Rajasthan in 1956 this
                region also came under the jurisdiction of the University of
                Rajputana, which was named as University of Rajasthan in 1957.
                With the establishment of a Board of Secondary Education in the
                State in 1957 the schools were transferred to this board and the
                University could then concentrate on development of higher
                education and research. The University of Rajasthan subsequently
                became a teaching-cum-affiliating University.

                The University owes much to the foresight, ability and sincerity
                of the first three Vice-Chancellors of the University viz. Dr.
                G.S. Mahajani, Dr. G.C. Chatterji and Dr. Mohan Sinha Mehta, who
                played a crucial role in the development of the University, its
                campus, recruitment of faculty and in laying down sound
                traditions. Each of the three distinguished and highly dignified
                Vice-Chancellors served the University for two successive terms,
                thus, guiding the destiny of the University for the first
                eighteen years, which was the formative period of the
                University. To them the University owes the image it came to
                acquire in the minds of the intellectual community of India.
                They brought in different faculties, some of the finest scholars
                who after having served in the University for many years, took
                up high positions at the national level. The names of Prof. M.
                V. Mathur, Prof. G. C. Pandey, Prof. Raj Krishna, Prof. Daya

                Chelliah, Prof. T.K.N. Unnithan are just a few names who brought
                glory and renown to the University.
